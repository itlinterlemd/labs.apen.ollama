### Prerequisites:

1.  **Docker & Docker Compose**: Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. You can follow the installation guides:
    
    *   Install Docker
        
    *   Install Docker Compose
        

### Steps to Install and Run:

1.  **Save Docker Compose File**:
    
    *   Create a directory where you want to run the Docker containers (e.g., chatollama-docker).
        
    *   Inside that directory, create a docker-compose.yml file and paste the contents of the provided docker-compose configuration.
 
    ```console
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    * This will:You can check the status of the containers with:
    ```console
    docker-compose ps
    ```
    
    *   Download the necessary Docker images for each service.
        
    *   Start all the services defined in your docker-compose.yml.
        
    *   Run the containers in detached mode (-d).
        

### Accessing the Model in the srvollama Container Terminal:

1.  
    ```console
    docker exec -it ollamasrv /bin/bash
    ```
   This opens a bash shell inside the ollamasrv container.
    
2.  
    ```console
    ollama download "your\_model\_name"
    ```
    If the model you need is ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2, then you can use the following:
    ```console
    ollama download "ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2"
    ```
    If the model is already specified in your environment, the container will attempt to download it automatically. Otherwise, you can manually download it through the ollama command.
    
3.  **Exit the Container**:Once the model is downloaded, you can exit the container by typing exit.
    

### Troubleshooting:

*   ```console
    docker-compose logs
    ```
    For example:
     ```console
    docker-compose logs ollamasrv
    ```
    This will display logs and may provide insights if there are any issues.
